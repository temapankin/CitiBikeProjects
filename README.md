# Researching biking in NYC

This repository contains Python, SQL, and Javascript code and some of the data used for the CitiBike Data and NYC's Bike Infrastructure projects I developed.
for three GIS classes I took at Hunter College:
- GTECH 361 GIS Analysis
- GTECH 38519/78519 Geospatial Databases
- GTECH 78534 WebGIS

Specifically, I developed the following project: 

1. **Spatial Decision Support System** that provides algorithms to solve the location-allocation problem of CitiBike stations in the expansion areas.
2. **CitiBike Trips Database**, which transforms original data into PostgreSQL DB with convenient formatting and additional geospatial metrics.
3. **Web-Map New York City Bike Infrastructure**, created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, showing different types of bike facilities in the city. [See result](https://temapankin.github.io/CitiBikeProjects/)
