# Researching Biking in NYC üö¥‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
This repository contains Python, SQL, and JavaScript code, along with selected datasets, developed for projects focused on CitiBike usage and New York City‚Äôs bike infrastructure. These projects were created as part of coursework in three GIS classes at Hunter College:

- GTECH 361 ‚Äì GIS Analysis
- GTECH 38519/78519 ‚Äì Geospatial Databases
- GTECH 78534 ‚Äì WebGIS

## Projects in This Repository
**1. Spatial Decision Support System (SDSS)**
An analytical tool designed to support decision-making for CitiBike station expansion. It implements algorithms to solve the location-allocation problem in underserved areas of NYC, helping planners identify potential sites for new bike stations. The output of the notebook serves as one of the layers of the GIS-based SDSS. 

**2. CitiBike Trips Database (DB)**
This component transforms raw CitiBike trip data into a structured PostgreSQL database. It includes scripts for data cleaning, formatting, and enrichment with geospatial metrics such as trip distance and direction. The resulting database supports more efficient querying and spatial analysis.

**3. NYC Bike Infrastructure Web Map**
A lightweight, interactive web map built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It displays different types of bike facilities across New York City, such as protected lanes and shared routes. This map allows users to explore the city‚Äôs cycling infrastructure visually.
